# Coach Steve

I coach people in software development by changing confusion into clarity. I reduce the noise to help people learn more effectively. I provide context and narrative to help the learning process be more enjoyable.

I am a lifelong student of leadership. Leading a team of 24 instructors requires creative strategies, promoting distributed leadership, and coaching others to become leaders.
